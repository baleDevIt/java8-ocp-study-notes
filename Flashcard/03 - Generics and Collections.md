**Answer 1:** Java throws a `ClassCastException` because `Rabbit` objects do not implement the `Comparable` interface, and `TreeSet` requires elements to be comparable to maintain their natural order.

**Question 2:** How can you prevent a `ClassCastException` when adding non-comparable objects to a `TreeSet`?

**Answer 2:** You can prevent a `ClassCastException` by providing a custom `Comparator` to the `TreeSet` constructor when adding non-comparable objects. This allows you to define the sorting logic explicitly.

**Flashcard Set 10: Using Method References**

**Question 1:** What is the purpose of method references in Java 8?

**Answer 1:** Method references in Java 8 provide a concise way to refer to methods, making the code more readable and reducing redundancy.

**Question 2:** What are the four formats for method references in Java 8?

**Answer 2:** The four formats for method references in Java 8 are:
1. Static methods.
2. Instance methods on a particular instance.
3. Instance methods on an instance to be determined at runtime.
4. Constructors.

**Flashcard Set 11: Removing Conditionally with `removeIf`**

**Question 1:** How does the `removeIf` method work in Java collections, and what type of parameter does it accept?

**Answer 1:** The `removeIf` method is used to remove elements from a collection based on a specified condition. It accepts a `Predicate` as a parameter, which is a lambda expression that returns a boolean.

**Flashcard Set 12: Updating All Elements with `replaceAll`**

**Question 1:** What is the purpose of the `replaceAll` method in Java collections, and what type of parameter does it require?

**Answer 1:** The `replaceAll` method in Java collections is used to update all elements in a collection using a specified transformation. It requires a `UnaryOperator` as a parameter, which is a lambda expression that takes one parameter and returns a value of the same type.

**Flashcard Set 13: Looping through a Collection with `forEach`**

**Question 1:** How can you iterate through a collection in Java using the `forEach` method and a lambda expression?

**Answer 1:** You can iterate through a collection in Java by using the `forEach` method, which takes a lambda expression specifying the action to be performed on each element.

# Using New Java 8 Map APIs

Certainly! Here are flashcards based on the provided text:

**Flashcard Set 16: New Java 8 Map APIs**

**Question 1:** What are the three new methods added to the Map interface in Java 8?

**Answer 1:** The three new methods added to the Map interface in Java 8 are `merge()`, `computeIfPresent()`, and `computeIfAbsent()`.

**Question 2:** How can you replace the existing value for a specific key in a map unconditionally?

**Answer 2:** You can replace the existing value for a specific key in a map unconditionally by using the `put()` method with the same key.

**Question 3:** What is the purpose of the `putIfAbsent()` method, and how does it work?

**Answer 3:** The `putIfAbsent()` method is used to set a value in the map if the key is not already mapped to a non-null value. It works by checking if the key is present and only sets the value if it is absent or mapped to a null value.

**Question 4:** How does the `merge()` method work, and what is its purpose?

**Answer 4:** The `merge()` method allows you to add custom logic when updating the value for a specific key in a map. It takes a mapping function that decides which value to keep based on the current value and the new value.

**Question 5:** What is the purpose of the `BiFunction` interface, and how is it used with the `merge()` method?

**Answer 5:** The `BiFunction` interface is a functional interface that takes two parameters of the same type and returns a value of the same type. It is used with the `merge()` method to provide custom logic for determining which value to keep when updating a map entry.

**Question 6:** When is the mapping function in the `merge()` method called, and what happens if it returns null?

**Answer 6:** The mapping function in the `merge()` method is called when there are two actual values to decide between. If the mapping function returns null, the key is removed from the map.

**Question 7:** What are the differences between `computeIfPresent()` and `computeIfAbsent()`?

**Answer 7:** 
- `computeIfPresent()`: This method is called when the requested key is found in the map. It allows you to compute a new value based on the existing key-value pair.
- `computeIfAbsent()`: This method is called when the requested key is not found in the map. It allows you to compute a value for the absent key.

**Flashcard Set 16 (Continued): New Java 8 Map APIs**

**Question 8:** In the `putIfAbsent()` method, when is a value set for a key, and when is it skipped?

**Answer 8:** In the `putIfAbsent()` method, a value is set for a key only if the key is absent or mapped to a null value. It is skipped if the key already has a non-null value.

**Question 9:** What is the behavior of the `merge()` method when the mapping function is not called?

**Answer 9:** The `merge()` method does not call the mapping function when there is only one value (i.e., one key-value pair) for the specified key. It is used only when there are two actual values to decide between.

**Question 10:** What happens to a key when the mapping function in the `merge()` method returns null?

**Answer 10:** When the mapping function in the `merge()` method returns null, the key is removed from the map.

**Question 11:** When using the `computeIfPresent()` method, when is the provided function called?

**Answer 11:** The `computeIfPresent()` method calls the provided function when the requested key is found in the map. It allows you to compute a new value based on the existing key-value pair.

**Question 12:** When using the `computeIfAbsent()` method, when is the provided function called?

**Answer 12:** The `computeIfAbsent()` method calls the provided function when the requested key is not found in the map. It allows you to compute a value for the absent key.

**Question 13:** Are the `computeIfPresent()` and `computeIfAbsent()` methods part of the OCP (Oracle Certified Professional) exam objectives?

**Answer 13:** No, the `computeIfPresent()` and `computeIfAbsent()` methods are not part of the OCP (Oracle Certified Professional) exam objectives. They are, however, included in the upgrade exam objectives.

**Flashcard Set 17 (Continued): Using New Java 8 Map APIs**

**Question 14:** What is the purpose of the `BiFunction` interface in the `merge()` method?

**Answer 14:** The `BiFunction` interface in the `merge()` method is used to define a mapping function that takes two parameters (two values associated with the same key) and returns a value. It determines how to resolve conflicts when two values are present for the same key.

**Question 15:** In the `merge()` method, how is the mapping function used to decide between two values for the same key?

**Answer 15:** In the `merge()` method, the mapping function is applied to two values associated with the same key. The function's logic determines which of the two values should be retained as the new value for the key. For example, you can choose the longer of the two values.

**Question 16:** When using the `merge()` method, what happens if the mapping function returns `null`?

**Answer 16:** If the mapping function in the `merge()` method returns `null`, the key-value pair is removed from the map.

**Question 17:** How does the `putIfAbsent()` method differ from the regular `put()` method?

**Answer 17:** The `putIfAbsent()` method differs from the regular `put()` method in that it sets a value for a key only if the key is absent or currently mapped to a `null` value. It skips setting a value if the key already has a non-null value.

**Question 18:** What is the key behavior of the `computeIfPresent()` method?

**Answer 18:** The `computeIfPresent()` method computes a new value for an existing key in the map if the key is found. It allows you to apply a function to the existing key-value pair to generate a new value.

**Question 19:** What is the key behavior of the `computeIfAbsent()` method?

**Answer 19:** The `computeIfAbsent()` method computes a value for a key that is not currently present in the map. It allows you to apply a function to generate a value for the absent key.

**Question 20:** Are the `computeIfPresent()` and `computeIfAbsent()` methods useful for handling simple value replacements or more complex logic?

**Answer 20:** The `computeIfPresent()` and `computeIfAbsent()` methods are useful for handling more complex logic when updating or adding values to a map. They allow you to apply custom logic to determine the new values based on the existing data in the map.
